# tobs - The Observability Stack for Kubernetes

Tobs is a tool that aims to make it as easy as possible to install a full observability
stack into a Kubernetes cluster. Currently this stack includes:

<img src="docs/assets/tobs-arch.png" alt="Tobs Architecture Diagram" width="800"/>

* [Kube-Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus#kube-prometheus) the Kubernetes monitoring stack
  * [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) to collect metrics
  * [AlertManager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager#alertmanager-) to fire the alerts
  * [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) to visualize what's going on
  * [Node-Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) to export metrics from the nodes
  * [Kube-State-Metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics) to get metrics from kubernetes api-server
  * [Prometheus-Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator#prometheus-operator) to manage the life-cycle of Prometheus and AlertManager custom resource definitions (CRDs)
* [Promscale](https://github.com/timescale/promscale) ([design doc](https://tsdb.co/prom-design-doc)) to store metrics for the long-term and allow analysis with both PromQL and SQL.
* [TimescaleDB](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb) for long term storage of metrics and provides ability to query metrics data using SQL.
* [Promlens](https://promlens.com/) tool to build and analyse promql queries with ease.
* [Opentelemetry-Operator](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator#opentelemetry-operator-for-kubernetes) to manage the lifecycle of OpenTelemetryCollector Custom Resource Definition (CRDs)

We plan to expand this stack over time and welcome contributions.

Tobs provides a helm chart to make deployment and operations easier. It can be used directly or as a sub-chart for other projects.

# üî• Quick start

## Prerequisites

Using tobs to install full observability stack with openTelemetry support currently requires installation of cert-manager. To do install it please follow [cert-manager documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/).

*Note*: cert-manager is not required when using tobs with opentelemetry support disabled.

## Installing the helm chart

The following command will install Kube-Prometheus, OpenTelemetry Operator, TimescaleDB, and Promscale
into your Kubernetes cluster:

```
helm repo add timescale https://charts.timescale.com/
helm repo update
helm install --wait <release_name> timescale/tobs
```

*Note*: `--wait` flag is necessary for successfull installation as tobs helm chart can create opentelemetry Custom Resources only after opentelemetry-operator is up and running. This flag can be omited when using tobs without opentelemetry support.

For detailed configuration and usage instructions, take a look at the [helm chart's README](/chart/README.md).

# Configuring the stack

All configuration for all components happens through the helm values.yaml file.
You can view the self-documenting [default values.yaml](chart/values.yaml) in the repo.
We also have additional documentation about individual configuration settings in our
[Helm chart docs](chart/README.md#configuring-helm-chart).

# üõ†Alternative deployment methods

## [DEPRECATED] Using the `tobs` CLI tool

We also provide a CLI tool to deploy tobs on a Kubernetes cluster. 

*NOTE*: At this point, the CLI tool is just a thin wrapper around the helm chart, and hence it's set to be removed in future releases. 

### Installing the CLI tool

To download and install tobs, run the following in your terminal, then follow the on-screen instructions.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' -A 'tobs' --tlsv1.2 -sSLf  https://tsdb.co/install-tobs-sh |sh
```

Alternatively, you can download the CLI directly via [our releases page](https://github.com/timescale/tobs/releases/latest)

Getting started with the CLI tool is a two-step process: First you install the CLI tool locally, then you use the CLI tool to install the tobs stack into your Kubernetes cluster.

### Using the tobs CLI tool to deploy the stack into your Kubernetes cluster

After setting up tobs run the following to install the tobs helm charts into your Kubernetes cluster

```bash
tobs install
```

This will deploy all of the tobs components into your cluster and provide instructions as to next steps.

#### Tracing support

From `0.7.0` release tobs supports installation of tracing components. To install tracing components use

```
tobs install --tracing
```

For more details on tracing support visit [Promscale tracing docs](https://github.com/timescale/promscale/blob/master/docs/tracing.md).

### Using the tobs CLI tool

The CLI tool ([usage guide](https://github.com/timescale/tobs/tree/master/cli#usage-guide)) provides the most seamless experience for interacting with tobs.
